# Capstone project 1

Objective :
	The objective of this project is to predict whether an article will be popular or not
prior to its publication by estimating the number of shares, using machine learning algorithms.The motivation behind tackling this problem is that before investing resources and time into the publication of a new article, we can predict whether or not it is worthy of being published in the first place.

Data Collection : 
The data was collected from the UCI Machine Learning repository. It contains the content of all the articles published during a two year period, from 2013 to 2015on Mashable (mashable.com).
